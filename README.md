# Chica client/server protocol hack
I was asked by a fellow resident of my retirement home to help his grandson make his hexapod more intelligent. The hexapod is based on the [Make Your Pet](https://github.com/MakeYourPet) and [Chica Server](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makeyourpet.chicaserver&hl=en_US&gl=US) android app.

It seemed to me that the easiest thing to do was to continue to use the Chica Server, and just send commands through to it from a more intelligent client.

## Details to note.
1) I will not be maintaining this repository. It is just somewhere convenient to dump this code & data.

2) I do not respond readily to emails. If you do send me an email and I do not respond after 6 months or so, then I am probably dead. (I am old, though I do sometimes go off grid for several months at a time.)

3) I don't do social media.

4) The program here is just a sample of how to talk the server.

5) What you should be reading is the protocol.rtf file.

## Enjoy.
